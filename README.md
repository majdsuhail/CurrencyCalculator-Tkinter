# Currency Calculator

Currency Calculator is a Python Tkinter program designed to effortlessly calculate both local and foreign currency conversions simultaneously.
You can specify the conversion rate and perform calculations by entering foreign currency values with a dollar sign ('$') to indicate it's foreign and local currency values without any symbol. 
Basic mathematical operations (+, -, *, /) are supported.

## Usage

1. Ensure `Tkinter` is installed before running the program
2. Run the program in a python IDE.
3. Enter the exchange rate in the "Exchange Rate" field.
4. Enter your calculations.. ex:`100$ + 100`.
5. Press "Convert to foreign currency" to Calculate the result in foreign currency or "Convert to local currency" to Calculate the result in local currency.
6. The result will be displayed in the "result=" field.

### Example:

- If the exchange rate is 30 and you calculate `100$ + 100`, the result will be `3100` if converted to local currency or `103.33` if converted to foreign currency.

## Requirements
